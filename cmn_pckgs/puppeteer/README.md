# Puppeteer How to Use (ChatGPT)

**You do not need to use this. At the time you are reading this, I already have
tested the ChatGPT agentic system. I am merely using this README for the sake of scientific reproducibility. If your goal is not reproducibility, there is no need to run this**

# Step 1: Start Chromium Puppet Browser
```bash
cd cmn_pckgs/puppeteer
node dist/chatgpt_login.js # Node.js required
```

# Step 2: Login

A browser just opened, likely Chromium. From here, create an account or login to your own already. It is highly advised to use a burner account in case anything goes wrong here. For the same reason, I advise making an account with OpenAI rather than using Google's authentication, as OpenAI has a weaker anti-bot.

Once you have created an account and can see the ChatGPT screen and are able to prompt, CLOSE OUT THE BROWSER. This will kill the console process of the login script. Proceed to next step once process killed.
