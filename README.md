# HLE Server

* This server does agentic HLE evaluation for any model/agent
* There will be multiple forms of such evaluation, with the most important one being the non-specific one (all LLM-based questions)

## Three Possible Directions

1. Professional Support

* Agentic startups do direct B2B work and get evaluations back within 1-2 business days
* Significantly less work on tech front, and personalized connections
* Downside is not fully agentic

2. Fully Agentic

* Less individual work, fully agentic, higher margins
* subject to being replicated, impossible to patent, loss of ethos

3. Not a Good Business Idea

* Make it open source and make it center of resume
